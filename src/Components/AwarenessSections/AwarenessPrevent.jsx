            Some details about how the disease is spread are unknown and is
            being determined.The WHO and CDC state that it is primarily spread
            during close contact and by respiratory droplets produced when
            people cough or sneeze; with close contact being within 1 to 2
            meters (3 to 6 feet). A study in Singapore found that an uncovered
            coughing can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).

            Respiratory droplets may also be produced during breathing out,
            including when talking, though the virus is not generally airborne.
            These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are
            nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some medical
